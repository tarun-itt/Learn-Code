# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Naming

- All names must be intention-revealing, pronounceable, and searchable.
- Avoid abbreviations, encodings, prefixes, and noise words.
- Single-letter names are only acceptable for short-loop iteration variables (`i`, `j`, `k`).
- **Files and classes:** UpperCamelCase.
- **Methods, variables, parameters, and fields:** lowerCamelCase.
- **Constants** (`static final`): UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- **Packages:** all lowercase.
- Don't use names that differ only in subtle ways (e.g., `controller` vs `controllerForHandling`).
- Pick one word per concept and use it consistently (e.g., don't mix `fetch`, `get`, `retrieve`).

---

## 2. Functions

- Keep functions small — ideally under 20 lines.
- A function should do one thing, at one level of abstraction.
- Use descriptive names; a long clear name beats a short cryptic one.
- Minimise arguments: zero is ideal, three or more should be encapsulated in an object.
- No boolean flag arguments — split into two clearly named functions.
- No side effects; a function should only do what its name promises.
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY).

---

## 3. Comments

- Comments are a last resort — prefer self-explanatory code over comments.
- **Acceptable:** legal notices, explanation of intent, clarification, warnings, TODOs, Javadoc on public APIs.
- **Avoid:** redundant comments, journal/changelog comments, closing-brace comments, commented-out code, attribution comments, positional markers.
- Comments for a variable, class, or function are placed **before** the commented component.

---

## 4. Formatting

### Vertical

- Use blank lines as paragraph separators between methods, field groups, and logical sections within a method.
- Related code stays close together; unrelated code is separated.
- Caller methods should appear above the methods they call (Stepdown Rule).
- Keep files under 500 lines.
- Every file ends with exactly **one trailing newline**.

### Horizontal

- Keep lines under 120 characters.
- Indent each nested block with **one tab**.
- One space around most operators (`x = y + z`), except `.`, `++`, `--`.
- One space before every opening `{`.
- No space between a function name and its argument list: `doWork(arg)`, not `doWork (arg)`.
- Always use braces for `if` / `for` / `while`, even single-line bodies.

---

## 5. Classes

- One top-level class per file; file name matches the class name.
- Each class has a single responsibility — describable without "and" or "or."
- Fields are `private`; expose behaviour through well-named methods, not raw data.
- Aim for high cohesion: most methods use most instance variables.
- Class member variables and methods follow **lowerCamelCase**.
- Organise members top-to-bottom: constants → static fields → instance fields → constructors → public methods → private methods.

---

## 6. Error Handling

- Use exceptions, not error return codes.
- Provide meaningful context in exception messages.
- Don't return `null` — return empty collections or `Optional` instead.
- Don't pass `null` as an argument unless an API explicitly requires it.
- Use unchecked exceptions to avoid leaking implementation details through the call chain.

---

## 7. Objects and Data Structures

- Objects hide data and expose behaviour; data structures expose data and have no behaviour. Don't create hybrids.
- Follow the **Law of Demeter**: a method should only talk to its immediate friends, not strangers down a chain of calls.

---

## 8. SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** one reason to change per class.
- **Open / Closed:** open for extension, closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution:** subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation:** many small interfaces over one large one.
- **Dependency Inversion:** depend on abstractions, not concretions.

---

## 9. Code Smells to Eliminate

- Dead code — delete, don't comment out.
- Magic numbers — replace with named constants.
- Feature envy — move the method to the class whose data it uses most.
- Primitive obsession — use domain types instead of raw primitives.
- Long parameter lists — encapsulate in an object.
- Divergent change / shotgun surgery — rebalance responsibilities.
- Inappropriate intimacy — classes should not dig into each other's internals.
